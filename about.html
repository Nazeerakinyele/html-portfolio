<h1>What is this?</h1>
<hr />  
<p>First and foremost I would like to say this is an in progress work. Im currently a student of the full stack development course on UDEMY and using this as an active web project. I just recently graduated from Rutgers University Newark with a Bachelor of Arts in Computer Science 
  and a minor in Data Science. Hopefully given the time and development, I can fully develop and integrate what ive learned slowly and surely.  </p>

<h2>What to Expect!</h2>  
<p>As of now Im linking all my basic project files ive worked on. These being contacts, about, movie rankings, and a birthday invite. Later down the line
  I'll plan on adding css but as for now this is strictly html.</p>
